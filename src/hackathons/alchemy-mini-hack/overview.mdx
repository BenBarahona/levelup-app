Test and level up your skills in this one-week online hackathon brought together by Alchemy and Scroll! All you need to do is deploy a contract on Scroll and leverage the Alchemy RPC via the Scroll API.

Forget product market fit, we're looking for your most creative, silly, moonshot ideas. Dream up the impossible, the ridiculous, the absolutely out-of-this-world projects and just build.

Here's to celebrating all you crazy, giga-brained developers ðŸ¥³

<strong>Dates</strong>
- Sept 24th to Sept 30th (submissions due September 30th, 5PM UTC)
